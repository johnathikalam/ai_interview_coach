# AI Interview Coach (MCP + FastAPI + LangChain)

## Overview
The **AI Interview Coach** is a session-based interview simulator built with **FastAPI, MCP, and LangChain**.  
It dynamically generates interview questions based on the **role** and **difficulty level** specified by the user.  
Each interview is tracked as a **session** where:  
- The system asks role-specific, difficulty-adjusted questions.  
- Users provide answers, and the AI gives **constructive feedback**.  
- All **questions, answers, feedback, and scores** are logged for review.  

This project can be used as a **guidance tool for interview preparation**.

## Features
- **Role-based interviews** (Java, AI/ML, React, etc.)  
- **Difficulty levels** -> Easy, Medium, Hard  
- **Session management** -> Each interview has its own session ID  
- **Dynamic question generation** -> Questions generated on the fly using LLMs  
- **Feedback system** -> AI provides 2â€“3 sentence feedback per answer  
- **History tracking** -> Review all Q&A after the session  

---

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.9+**  
- **FastAPI** -> API framework  
- **FastAPI-MCP** -> MCP integration  
- **LangChain + OpenAI** -> AI model orchestration  
- **Pydantic** -> Request/response validation

}
```

---

### 2. Answer a question
```http
POST /answer_question
```
**Request:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "1234-5678",
  "answer": "LSTMs are a type of RNN that use gates to control memory flow..."
}
```
**Response:**
```json
{
  "feedback": "Good answer! You explained the role of gates well, but mention vanishing gradients.",
  "next_question": "What is RAG in GenAI?"
}
```
